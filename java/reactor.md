### Explanations

Reactor is an implementation of the reactive programming paradigm which could be describe as follow:
>Reactive programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. This means that it becomes possible to express static (e.g. arrays) or dynamic (e.g. event emitters) data streams with ease via the employed programming language(s).

Reactor allows one to perform asynchronous and non-blocking tasks with a publisher-subscriber model
